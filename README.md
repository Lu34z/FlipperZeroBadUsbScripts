# FlipperZeroBadUsbScripts
A bunch of scripts I have made for the BADUSB on the Flipper Zero.
Some of this is school safe meaning that the school computers will not block it
and some of them will be blocked by the school administrators. If you want to
learn how to make these scripts yourself, check out my youtube. I will probably
post a video on how to program in Ducky Script soon, so make sure to turn notis on!
